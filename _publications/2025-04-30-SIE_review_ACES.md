In this review, we present the theoretical analysis of a general electromagnetic problem that leads to different surface integral equation (SIE) formulations. We discuss integral operators, integral equations and different formulations. Moreover, we delve into the various components of a discretization scheme, such as the singularity subtraction and the utilization of different basis and testing functions, by providing also a mathematical overview of function spaces to explain the significance of combining basis and testing functions properly. Furthermore, we go through several results from various published works, in order to compare different formulations and discretization procedures, so that we can draw specific conclusions about them alone and also about their combination. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion on numerical solvers and approaches.

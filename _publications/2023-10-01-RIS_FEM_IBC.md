Highlights: A systematic approach to synthesize an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), novel varactor-controlled unit cell with appealing scattering features, fast analytical method based on Floquet mode analysis for periodic IRS design, fast and robust procedure for the optimization of IRSâ€™s efficiency, finite element analysis (FEA) to model IRS as an equivalent zero-thickness impedance sheet.

excerpt: 'In this work, we address the hybrid discretization scheme by first establishing in detail the corresponding formalism and then presenting several numerical examples, which involve plasmonic and hybrid nanostructures. Through this detailed study, we demonstrate the validity of the approach and the primary differences between homogeneous (only triangular or quadrilateral) and hybrid discretizations in terms of accuracy and computational time.'

I am a PhD student in the Electrical Engineering Department (EDEE) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), affiliated with the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM), part of the Microengineering Department (IEM) at EPFL.

I was born in Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece, in 1998, and received my Integrated Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh) in 2022.

In my third year of undergraduate studies, I joined the AcubeSAT project under the Aristotle Space & Aeronautics Team (ASAT), which focused on the development of nanosatellites, rockets, and UAVs. As a communications engineer, I contributed in the team’s successful admission to the “Fly Your Satellite! 3” (FYS) educational program, organized by the European Space Agency (ESA). Our team, later reestablished as SpaceDot, was one of only three selected to participate in the FYS program.

During the final year of my studies, I conducted my diploma thesis at the Radar and Microwaves Laboratory, supervised by Prof. Traianos Yioultsis. My research focused on the computational analysis of metasurfaces using Impedance Boundary Conditions (IBCs) within the Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. This involved the implementation of 2D/3D elements, absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs), perfectly matched layers (PMLs), and the total-field to scattered-field (TF/SF) formulation.

After completing my mandatory military service in the Greek Army in 2023, I joined NAM at EPFL, where I currently conduct research in surface integral equations, metasurfaces, photonics, and plasmonics.

He received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh), Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece, in 2022. In 2023, he joined the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM), ´Ecole Polytechnique F´ed´erale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, as a Ph.D. student. He is currently conducting  research on the development of numerical techniques for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems on plasmonic, dielectric and hybrid systems. His research interests are in the areas of computational electromagnetics, metasurfaces, microwaves, photonics and plasmonics.

Work experience
======
* Doctoral Assistant, Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory, EPFL, 09/2023 -- present
  * Conducting research on the surface integral equation (SIE) method for electromagnetic scattering problems in optics and nanophotonics.
  * Developing a C++ code for layered media Green’s functions and light scattering computations with SIE.
  * Implementing numerical models for light--matter interactions at the nanoscale, including plasmonic and molecular systems.

Research & Volunteering experience
======
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Radar and Microwaves Lab, AUTh, 07/2021 -- 07/2022

I am pleased to announce that the final version of our paper “A systematic approach for reconfigurable reflecting metasurface synthesis: From periodic analysis to far-field scattering” is now available online in “AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications”.

In this paper you can find:
- A systematic and straightforward approach to synthesize an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS).
- Novel reconfigurable unit cell structure achieving a wide range of phase shifts, low losses and polarization insensitivity.
- Fast analytical method, based on Floquet mode analysis for the design of periodic IRS.
- Fast and robust procedure for the optimization of IRS’s efficiency.
- Efficient finite element method (FEM) analysis for modeling IRS as an equivalent impedance sheet of zero-thickness.

I would like to thank all the co-authors, namely Konstantinos Ntokos, Athanasios Iossifides (Iosifidis) and Traianos V. Yioultsis.

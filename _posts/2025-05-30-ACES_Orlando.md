üéôÔ∏è It was a fantastic experience presenting at the 2025 International ACES Symposium in Orlando, Florida, US!

Two months ago, I had the pleasure of participating in the ACES - Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society Symposium. It was a truly rewarding experience to engage with the global computational electromagnetics community, share ideas, meet experts, and gain fresh perspectives on emerging techniques and challenges in the field.

I was honored to present our work with Prof. Olivier J.F. Martin, from the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM) at EPFL. My talk, titled: "Modeling Light Scattering in Layered Media with the Surface Integral Equation Method", presented a versatile framework for simulating electromagnetic scattering interactions using SIE, aiming for more accurate and efficient approaches in nanophotonics.

A heartfelt thank you to the organizing committee for putting together such a well-structured and engaging event. Special thanks to everyone who stopped by our session or shared insights during the coffee breaks‚Äîyour feedback and questions were genuinely appreciated.

Looking forward to more stimulating discussions at next year's edition in Thessaloniki, Greece!

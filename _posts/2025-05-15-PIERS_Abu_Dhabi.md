🎙️ Grateful and proud to have participated in PIERS Abu Dhabi 2025 with three oral presentations! 🔬

Last week, I had the privilege of giving three oral presentations at the PhotonIcs and Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS) - a fantastic opportunity to share our latest research and engage with an international community of experts in electromagnetics, photonics, and numerical modeling.

🗣️ My talks included the following topics:
🔹 Modeling Complex Atomic Structures with the Surface Integral Equation Method.
🔹 Self-Consistent Modeling of Coupled Maxwell–Bloch Equations with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method.
🔹 Modeling Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with the Finite Element Method.

These works represent exciting collaborations between:
📍 Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM) at EPFL,
📍 FEMTO-ST Institute (CNRS), and
📍 Radar and Microwaves Unit at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh).

Many thanks to all collaborators and supervisors of these works - Stavros Athanasiou, Nicolas Brosseau-Habert, Konstantinos Ntokos, Prof. M. Devel, Prof. T.V. Yioultsis, and Prof. Olivier J.F. Martin - and to the PIERS team for organizing such a well-structured and stimulating event!

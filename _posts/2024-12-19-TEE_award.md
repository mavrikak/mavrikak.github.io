On December 19, 2024, I had the honor of being recognized among the top graduates of engineering schools in Greece (2017-2022) during a special awards ceremony organized by the Technical Chamber of Greece (TCG).

I am truly grateful for this acknowledgment, which reflects my effort as well as the support and guidance that I received throughout my academic journey. A heartfelt thank you to TCG and everyone involved in this initiative for encouraging and celebrating young engineers. This milestone motivates me to continue learning and contributing to the engineering and academic communities to the best of my ability.

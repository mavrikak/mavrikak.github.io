I’m happy to share that I’ve started my Doctor of Philosophy - PhD at EPFL! 

I would like to thank all the members of the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory - NAM, who welcomed me very warmly. I am looking forward to contributing to the research goals of NAM and improving in the field of computational electromagnetics and metasurface modeling!

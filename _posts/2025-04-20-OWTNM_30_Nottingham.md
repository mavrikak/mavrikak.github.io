A great experience presenting at the 31st OWTNM in Nottingham!

Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in the 31st International Workshop on Optical Wave & Waveguide Theory and Numerical Modelling (OWTNM) in Nottingham, UK. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with fellow researchers, exchange ideas, and immerse myself in the vibrant community advancing photonics and computational electromagnetics.

I was honored to present our joint research conducted in collaboration with Stavros Athanasiou and Prof. Olivier J.F. Martin, from the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory - NAM (www.nanophotonics.ch) at EPFL. My presentation, titled: "Self-Consistent Modeling of Coupled Maxwell-Bloch Equations with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method," introduces a robust framework for the numerical modeling of light-matter interactions with the FDTD method, which provides a promising step toward accurate and efficient modeling in quantum optics.

A huge thank you to Prof. Sendy Phang and Prof. Ana Vukovic for hosting such a well-organized and engaging event, and to everyone who contributed to the thoughtful discussions during and after the session.

Looking forward to reconnecting with the community at next yearâ€™s edition that will be organized by our lab at EPFL!

I’m delighted to share my latest publication, "Hybrid Meshes for the Modeling of Optical Nanostructures with the Surface Integral Equation Method," which has recently been released! This work explores the surface integral equation (SIE) method, providing fresh insights into hybrid discretization schemes for modeling plasmonic and hybrid nanostructures.

I’m incredibly grateful to my co-author, Prof. Olivier J.F. Martin, for his contribution and support in this work.

If you’re interested in the SIE method and the advantages of hybrid discretization approaches, I’d love to hear your thoughts! You can check the publication out at the following link.

Looking forward to engaging in insightful and constructive discussions!
